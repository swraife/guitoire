      missing_area_or_tags_help: >
        Q: What if my skills or tags aren't listed?  A: No worries, this is
        just a quick start. Select 'other' and/or add custom tags for what you
        do. You'll be able to customize more later.
      multiple_workspaces_help: >
        Q: What if I need two workspaces?  A: For related skills that you
        might practice or perform at the same time, or with the same people,
        we recommend using only one workspace. However, if you do want a
        second workspace, you'll be able to create it later.

      warning: >
        It looks you're adding a second workspace. Just so you know, you're
        workspaces are kept completely separate from each other. This means
        separate followers, groups, newsfeeds, etc. This is so you can keep, for
        example, your aerials acts separate from your metal band. For similar
        skills like juggling and unicycling, which you might perform in the
        same act or with the same group, it's usually easier to keep them in
        one workspace and use tags to stay organized.
